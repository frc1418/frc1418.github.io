        <p>We are team 1418 Vae Victis, a <a href="http://firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)</a> team from Meridian High School in Falls Church, VA. Since our founding in 2004, our team has grown in every way, and has maintained a high place in competition and in the community. To do this, we maintain an active and engaged student body of around fifteen students who work with the team on and off season. We are proud to have experienced success in competition. We have made it to four FIRST World Championships: in St. Louis, Missouri (2016 and 2017) and Detroit, Michigan (2018 and 2019). Outside of competition, we pride ourselves on involvement in our community. We have hosted free summer camps to educate elementary school students on basic LEGO Robotics, and volunteered to help run FIRST Lego League competitions in the past. We've even helped to start robotics teams in rural Ecuador and help educate students living there. More information about our outreach efforts can be found <a href="outreach">here</a>.</p>
