	<h1>Local FRC Outreach</h1>
	<h5>Supporting Local Teams</h5>
	<p>For many years now, 1418 has "adopted" a rookie or younger team for a season to help them get into the swing of things, let them borrow our shop and tools, or to just lend a helping hand when it comes to robot construction. Teams we have supported have included George Marshall's Gryphon Robotics (5549), D.C.Ps School without Walls's Mighty Penguins (2900), K.I.P.P.'s RoboPanthers (2964), Saint John's College High School's Mech Cadets (4456), Falls Church High School's Jagwires (6504), and Pinnecal Academy's pumaTECH (6543). Currentlty we are supporting Yorktown High School's Ocebots (9033).</p>
	<p>In addition, every year Vae Victis hosts a scrimmage with local teams. This is helpful since many teams do not have our resources and cannot construct practice fields.</p>

	<h5>FRC Workshops</h5>
	<p>Every December since 2009, 1418 has hosted a workshop featuring classes that teach important skills to both team members and mentors. The available courses include Pneumatics, 3D Printing, Game strategy, and Scouting. Vae Victis was proud to successfully host the event as well as teach many of the courses this year and plans to do the same for many years to come. The members, along with mentors and parents set-up the classrooms serve food, guide visitors and teach many of the training sessions. The event attracts approximately 25 teams and 150 – 200 attendees.</p>

	<h5>Support to FIRST Senior Mentor</h5>
	<p>The local FIRST Senior Mentor (FSM) has 5 FTC demo robots that require significant maintenance and rework. FRC 1418 provides the maintenance for the robots which are used throughout the year at FIRST and non-FIRST events. The robots need major work after the children earn their “Robot Driver’s License” at events as well updating hardware and software for the robots. It is estimated over 1000 children earned their robot driver’s license this year. The demo robots are used at events like the VA Tech MakerFaire and DCPD “Beat the Streets” as well many FIRST and Sponsor Events. The team also maintains the FTC practice field for the FSM.</p>
	<h1>Local Community Outreach</h1>
	<h5>Brownie Troop Visit</h5>
	<p>Team 1418 entertained a visit from a Girl Scout Brownie Troop, showcasing their workshop with a tour and providing insight into their robot. The team also assisted the young girls in constructing their own Bristlebots, making it an educational and fun experience.</p>

	<h1>International Outreach</h1>
	<h5>Ecuador Workshop</h5>
	<p>MHS's Robotics Team 1418 members created a robotics workshop for a high school in San Miguel de los Bancos in rural Ecuador. The workshop took place from August 18th until August 22nd. The objective was to teach students about robotics and plant a seed of interest in new technologies so that these students can later create their own robotics team and get interested in STEM careers. 24 students from Bernabé de Larraúl High School participated in this workshop. The students learned about building and programing robots through a hands on experience. The students were separated into three groups of 8 students each. The first day we showed them one of the robots that they would be building and let them get familiar with the pieces. Everyday after that the groups would build different kinds of robots that had different purposes (e.g. Clawbot, Autonomous robot, etc.) and would compete against each other. After each competition, we would all regroup and discuss how the robots performed. If the groups had difficulties while building the robot or on the field during this time they would reflect on what went wrong and how they could prevent the problem in the future. On the third day, students and faculty watched the movie: Underwater Dreams about how a High School robotics team in a poor community in Arizona beat the MIT team in an underwater robotics competition. This was very inspiring for the students. At the end of the workshop the students evaluated their experience and we learned that these students left the workshop knowing so much more about all the components of robotics (building the robot as well as programming the robot). In fact, many felt that this was a life changing experience. Fe y Alegría Ecuador, the parent organization that manages the schools nationwide, is interested in expanding this program to other places.</p>
