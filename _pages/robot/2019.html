    <p>The 2019 game's throwback to the Apollo 11 landing 50 years before provides a certain challenge for our team. It involves placing large balls and hatches into different locations on the field. To get a more detailed description of the game, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mew6G_og-PI">the official video reveal</a>.</p>
    <h5>Robot Abilities</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mecanum Drive:</strong> Mecanum drive will be our drive method of choice this year. This ensures more efficent maneuverability to line up with any and all game pieces using its straffing abilities. It will be controlled by two joysticks, one for rotational movement and one for straffing and vertical movement.  </li>
        <li><strong>Elevator System:</strong> The moment the challenge was introduced, we knew being able to deliver items to the top of the rocket was a must. We did have some issues, but below is the (hopefully) final description of the elevator.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cargo Intake:</strong> On the front of the elevator system lies a "U" shaped compnent with wheels attached to motors that suck in and spit out the cargo at astonishing speeds. </li>
          <li><strong>Hatch Delivery:</strong> Placed directly on top of the cargo instake system, the final design has no yet been attached to the robot</li>
          <li><strong>Winch:</strong> Utilizing a massive speed reduction gearbox, our robot has the capabillity to reach the top of the rocket.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Climber Pistons:</strong> Our secondary objective was to climb the HAB. To do so, we are using three 12 inch pistons that will extend into the ground and push the robot up onto the second HAB level.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Programming</h5>
    <p>Just like in previous years, we used Python for our robot code. In addition to our robot code, we developed a dashboard for our touchscreen driver station. It is written in JavaScript/HTML/CSS, and communicates with the robot through a python-based tornado server. It is based on the <a href="https://github.com/FRCDashboard/FRCDashboard">FRCDashboard</a> framework we developed in 2016.</p>
    <p>We drive using a pilot-copilot operating system, with one driver controlling robot motion and the other controlling all other robot functions. This allows each driver to control their own independent task, making operating the robot more efficient.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Vision Software:</strong> With vision tape on the rocket and cargo ship, good vision software is very important to this challenge. Programmed in Python, this software uses data from a camera located on the elevator system and lots of math to position the robot correctly. There is also a button on one of the joysticks that runs the software in order to ensure the robot is perfectly lined up in TeleOp.
    </ul>
    <p>As usual, our code is open source, and can be found on <a href="https://www.github.com/frc1418">our GitHub organization</a>. Here are some quick links:</p>

    <h5>Competition Performance</h5>
    <p>We will be competing in two competitions this year at Battlefield HS (March 1-3) and at Oxon Hill HS (March 22-24).
