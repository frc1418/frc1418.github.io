    <p>This year's challenge is called FIRST STEAMworks. It is steampunk themed, and is focused around moving balls and gears between locations to score points. For a more detailed description, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMiNmJW7enI">the official video reveal</a>.</p>
    <p>The build season is currently going on, and our robot is still a work in progress. So far we have a shooter, gear mechanism and climber.
    <h5>Robot Abilities</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Swerve Drive: </strong>This year's game relies heavily on agility. The swerve drive train gives us a huge advantage while picking up and placing gears.</li>
        <li><strong>Ball collection/shooting apparatus: </strong>Our robot has the capacity to rapidly pick up, store and shoot balls. We have an intake on the underside of our robot which allows us to pick up balls by driving into them. We can hold 15 balls at any time. Our shooter has been able to achieve 90% accuracy at 3 balls per second. We're still working on this and it may be modified before the final robot is released.</li>
        <li><strong>Gear arm: </strong>Our robot can deploy a gear collection arm to pick gears up off the floor. This means we do not have to rely on delivery from dispensers, which may be unreliable.</li>
        <li><strong>Rope climb: </strong>Our robot can climb the rope in 12 seconds currently, using a winch mechanism.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Programming</h5>
    <p>Just like in previous years, we used Python for our robot code. The code uses “MagicRobot”, a part of the RobotPy library that makes using objects between classes easy. It is object-oriented, and controls our arm using custom PID control.</p>
    <p>In addition to our robot code, team member <a href="https://github.com/ErikBoesen">Erik Boesen</a> leads development of a a UI for our touchscreen driver station. It is written in JavaScript/HTML/CSS, and communicates with the robot through a python-based tornado server.</p>
    <p>Member <a href="https://github.com/ErikBoesen">Erik Boesen</a> then simplified, cleaned up, and rereleased the UI as <a href="https://frcdashboard.github.io">FRC Dashboard</a>, a more easily-customizable and repurposable version of the UI.</p>
    <p>All our code can be found on <a href="https://www.github.com/frc1418">our GitHub organization</a>.</p>
